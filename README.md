# Slide Organization Management System

## Background 

Quick overview of project's context, problem, and my proposed solution.

### Context

SLIDE (Sophomore Leaders Impacting, Developing, and Impacting) is a sophomore organization at Texas A&M that promotes student leadership by tackling many issues on campus and in our community that often go unspoken such as mental health and sexual assault. The organization is composed of approximately 115 students, including both staff and general members. The organization keeps members accountable by having a point system where each event corresponds to a certain number of points. Each member to get a certain number of service and social points in order to avoid being placed on probation the following semester. Moreover, members have to appeal events they are going to miss.


### Problem

Members submitted their points online through a google form and they could view their total number of points on google a Ã¥spreasheet. However, that spreadsheet was not private and anyone could see the points of other people. Also, members had to sign in during meetings on a piece of paper which would eventually be lost. Members submitted their appeals on a google form but there was no way to know if staff actually approved it or not. Even when staff reached a decision, they would send an email to the person that appealed but there was no guarantee that he or she was going to see it.


### Solution

As a member of the organization, I was able to witness all of the challenges. This first-hand experience allowed me to get a better idea on how to tackle those challenges. As a result, I decided to develop a web application that would serve as an organization management system. All of the tasks that used to be done manually or through party services would be done on a single interface.
